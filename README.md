# Microservices Challenge 

## Introduction 

Implementation of the backend of a presence control system for the employees of a company. Employees must always clock in and out by registering their fingerprint.  The “People” department will need:  

* Access to the employee’s presence and time control.
* Generation of time sheets of effective worked hours.
* Reception of asynchronous notifications regarding: total absence time, absence anomalies, etc.
