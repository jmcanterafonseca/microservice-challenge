# Microservices Challenge 

## Introduction 

Design and implement the backend for a presence control system for the employees of a company. You need to take into consideration that the employees must always clock in and out by registering their fingerprint.  The “People” department will need:  

* Access to the employee’s presence and time control.
* Generation of time sheets of effective worked hours.
* Reception of asynchronous notifications regarding: total absence time, absence anomalies (for example because of on-call duties), etc.
